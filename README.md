# Enhanced Flashbangs

Enhanced Flashbangs adds an extra dimension to the flashbangs in Counter Strike. The software and hardware combine
to enable the ultra-bright lights at the bottom of the computer monitor whenever an 
in-game flashbang has been used on your player.

Here's a sample video of the device being used:
